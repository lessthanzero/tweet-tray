Tweet Tray is a small application which allows you to tweet from your desktop taskbar or menubar, without any further distractions. The core technology used consists of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). All transpiled from ES6 Javascript.

## Install with Homebrew

You can also do `brew cask install tweet-tray`, if [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed.

## Settings
Some application settings can be passed via commandline arguments. For a full list, run the executable from the commandline with the  `--help` argument. 
- `--proxy` You can configure Tweet Tray to use a HTTP [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server), by setting the `--proxy` argument.  This takes a string value of the proxy server address and port, in the form of `--proxy address:port`.  This also supports [SOCKS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) by using the `socks5` protocol prefix, eg `--proxy socks5://address:port`. 

## Report Bugs
Please create a Github [issue](https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray/issues) and provide as much information as possible regarding the bug, including images or error codes. To make things as uniform as possible please follow the guidelines set out in `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Development

1. Fork the Tweet Tray repository on Github to your own account then clone it locally.

2. To run Tweet Tray locally you will need to first install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package managers.

3. Setup the applications' dependencies by navigating to the `tweet-tray` directory and run `yarn install`.

4. Before you can use all functions of Tweet Tray you'll need to create your own [Twitter OAuth Application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) to test. You don't need to set a callback URL, as Tweet Tray uses a mannually input Authorization code. After that, take the Consumer Key and Secret and update your local `config.js` file found under `app/utils`.

5. After everything has been installed simply call `yarn dev` to run the development build. To run the production build you can call `yarn prestart` followed by `yarn start`.

For all new features or bug fixes please create an issue in the main repository first (so we can track what goes into each release) then simply submit a pull request from your own fork into the original `develop` branch. To make sure the changes are easily reviewable please repect the format set out in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Deployment

To create an installable build simply call `yarn package`, which will create an executable based on your current operating system. If you want to debug something in a packaged build you can call `DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package`.
